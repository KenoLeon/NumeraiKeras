# NumeraiKeras üß†

**Keras-Tensorflow boilerplate starter for the [Numerai][d3d768b1]
 competition.**

## What is it ?

I wanted to use [Keras][12781e27] for the Numerai tournament and couldn't find a basic example  so I made this one.

## Medium Article :

  If you are new to the competition and/or want a better explanation of the code see this companion post:

## Validation/Metrics:

There's a separate script to calculate Validation Correlation ([val_corr.py][cf7ec790]) which should match the one generated by Numerai.

And some metrics ([metrics.py][3f432b7b]) contributed by [parmarsuraj99][790a9a80]:

## Caveat Emptor (Buyer Beware)
Out of the box this NN/ Model is not very good, you need to tune parameters, add your preferred validation, tweak the model, etc, etc  see the following section...   


## Contribute - To Do - Upgrades:

Open an issue or pm on the Numerai chat if you want to add your contributions.

Ideally each new contribution is a standalone script with a new feature, some missing features :

- Save the model ( as to not retrain )
- Cross validation ( within the dataset and with val1 val2 )
- Payout scores and metrics (see Validation)
- Parameter tuning.
- Colab/jupyter notebook.
- Your suggestion ?

It would really be cool to have a community model to go against example_predictions, just saying...



## Feeling generous ?
Toss a üí∞to your üßô‚Äçer !
