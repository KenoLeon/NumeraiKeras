## What is it ?

I wanted to use [Keras][12781e27] for the Numerai tournament and couldn't find a basic example  so I made this one.

## Caveat Emptor (Buyer Beware)
Out of the box this NN/ Model is not very good, you need to tune parameters, add your preferred validation, tweak the model, etc, etc  see the following section...   


## Contribute - ToDo - Upgrades:

Open an issue or pm on the Numerai chat if you want to add your contributions.

Ideally each new contribution is a standalone script with a new feature, some missing features :

- Save the model ( as to not retrain )
- Cross validation ( within the dataset and with val1 val2 )
- Payout scores and metrics.
- Parameter tuning.
- Colab/jupyter notebook.
- Your suggestion ?

It would really be cool to have a community model to go against example_predictions, just saying...


## Coming soon

Medium post.
